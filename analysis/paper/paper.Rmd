# Introduction

Burials provide valuable information about social structures that reflect not only the personal life and status of the deceased, but also the expressions of their descendants, from which we are able to detect the social differences that can relate to social inequality and complexity (Ehrhardt 2009; Gamble and Zepeda 2002; Janes 2013; Johansen and Bauer 2015). Mortuary practices such as burial forms, grave goods, and related ritual practices could represent the social relations between individuals and allow us to infer social structures, for examples, grave goods usually relate to social practices of trade, exchange, and gifting (Coward 2013: 252). One way to study the relationships between individual is network analysis, where burials represent actors, nodes in the network, linked by sharing the same attributes such as the same prestige goods. 

Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a tool for understanding network structure and its effects on every part within the network (Freeman 2004; Salvini 2010). A social network contains a set of actors and a set of relationships connecting these actors, which could be groups, organizations or persons. Their relationships are flows of resources that reflect relations of control, dependence, and cooperation. In other words, actors are viewed as ‘nodes’ in a wider network, in which nodes are connected by multiple relationships, or ‘edges’, to other nodes (Coward 2013; Mizoguchi 2013; Potgieter, et al. 2008). SNA provides a way to visualize, quantify, and statistically test hypotheses about the relationships between actors. At Kiwulan, I will use individual burials as actors or nodes in the social network, and use SNA methods to test hypotheses about the distribution of influence in the network to identify network or corporate mode conditions. Network ties will be drawn between burials with similar variables that can represent the same ‘community’ or social group. To measure change in social inequality, I will use the binary presence or absence of burial goods, the amount of prestige goods, grave dimensional attributes, and ordinal variables of age and sex categories to determine which actors have connections in the network (Sosna, et al. 2012).
Once the relationships between the actors have been described, I will compute statistical measures such as network degree centrality, graph density, and graph centralization. These measures are helpful to identify individual’s role and trends of network relationship, and I will use them to formally test hypotheses about the structure of the social network (Brughmans 2010: 280; Gjesfjeld 2014: 192). I predict that if there is a change from corporate to network mode following the European contact, then I expect the social network will show statistically significantly higher degrees of centrality and a higher density in the post-European period compared to pre-European period. This is because a social network graph that is highly centralized and very sparse indicates high concentrations of wealth, and higher social inequality.
 

Do the observed burial data indicate a more clustered network than a distribution of random networks with similar qualities?
We ask whether European colonial activities in 17 century Taiwan resulted in the emergence of social inequality in an indigenous society. We use social network analysis (SNA) where burials represent actors (nodes in the network) linked by sharing the same prestige goods. Do the observed burial data indicate a more clustered network than a distribution of random networks with similar qualities?

Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are an important family of statistical models for analyzing network data and evaluating models of network structure. However, ERGMs are difficult to compute because their normalizing constant, which depends on model parameters, is intractable. A Bayesian framework allows for parameter inference using MCMC strategies which avoid the need for computationally intensive calculations of the normalizing constants. Using the R language, we use Bayesian SNA to study burials from Kiwulan, an Iron Age site in northeast Taiwan. We expect the network to present a higher degree of clustering (e.g. the number of completed triangles in the network) in the European contact period that might hint at social heterogeneity during this period. This study helps to expand the use of burials in understanding the indirect effects of a colonial presence on indigenous groups. A Bayesian approach enables the efficient quantification for uncertainty, parametrization, and model evaluation of social network metrics.

# Archaeological background

Based on the quantity and quality of grave goods among burials, we can reconstruct social networks from the distribution of prestige goods, including imported ceramic and beads based on the principle that prestige materials usually relate to social status. 

# Methods

## Exponential Random Graph Models

Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) are a family of statistical model for network analysis to describe the formation of ties in a network. In traditional statistical model for network, a dyad, the pair of nodes, is measured by the presence of a tie according to the attributes of the nodes or ties, where each predictor variable for forming a tie is measured separately. In contrast to traditional model where variables not interacting with each other, ERGMs assumes the formation of a tie is influenced by the presence or absence of other ties or attributes of nodes and ties (Robins et al. 2007). In a network using ERGMs, predictor variables, called "network statistics", are direct functions of the ties themselves that the probability of occurrence of the configuration of ties can be hypothesized [@Morris2008]. This approach enables networks to be constructed in a variety of assumption and contexts to model social network in the past using archaeological data [@Amati2019]. 

some concepts:
- endogenous statistics that ties are modelled based on the existence of other ties
- exogenous statistics that ties are formed according to monadic or dyadic node attributes


## statistics
We want to know 

ERGM- consider transitivity by taking into account high-order k-triangles. Triangles and higher order cycles

We used ergm package in R for the model specification. Every term in an ERGM must have an associated algorithm for computing its value for network [@Morris2008]. The terms we selected for nwtwork specification include:

1. edges: ties, a measure of density, equal to kstar(1) for undirected networks

2. gwesp (geometrically weighted edgewise shared partners): a dyad-based configurations (not node-based) that counts the number of times that both nodes have a tie to a third node. It is a measure of the tendency for two actors who are tied to have x partners in common.

3. gwdegree (geometrically weighted degree distribution): a parametric form that represents the frequency distribution for nodal degree, each node counts only once. The local configuration is degrees and stars that are equivalent representations for the distribution of node-based edge counts

# Results

```{r model-ergm-1}
model.ergm <- burial_network_pre ~ 
  edges + # ties, a measure of density, equal to kstar(1) for undirected networks
  density +
  gwdegree(0.5, fixed = TRUE)  +
  triangle # triad relation, a measure of clustering or cohesion, also called transitive triple in undirected network
summary(model.ergm)
```

```{r model-ergm-2}
model.2 <- burial_network_pre ~ edges + # density
  gwesp(0.2, fixed = TRUE) +  # transitivity(cohesion; triangle), a tendency for those with shared partners to become tied, or tendency of ties to cluster together
  # triad-based clustering according to dyad-based configurations instead of node-based
  # number means weight parameter alpha, which controls the rate of declining marginal returns
  # fixed = TRUE means the scale parameter lambda is fit as a curved exponential-family model
  # not much difference in a range of 0-1.5, the lower the value of the scaling parameter, the less likely the model is to be degenerate
  # ergm can estimate the parameter from the data by using fixed=FALSE

  gwdegree(0.8, fixed = TRUE)  # popularity(degree; star), the frequency distribution for nodal degrees
  # tendency of being in contact with multiple partners, measures of centralisation
  # distribution of node-based edge counts, each node counts only once
  # number means weight parameter decay

The summary presents the statistics that each θ corresponds to the parameter specified in ERGM previously. In general, positive mean indicates positive correlation, while negative mean indicates negative correlation. 

θ1 = number of ties
θ2 = individuals with the same abundance of burial goods
θ3 = gwesp is negative that rejects the assumption that actors with multiple partners in common are more likely to be directed connected
θ4 =
